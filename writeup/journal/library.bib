@article{Garnier2007,
	abstract = {The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects' colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the un- derlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems.We emphasize in partic- ular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system's parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we ad- dress the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that fu- ture studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.},

By this we mean that the categories of young children include information about ontology, causation, function, intentions, and other properties that are not directly observable. Moreover, children use their categories to form important inferences and explanation that go beyond the available evidence. In the first part of the chapter we review evidence for theory-based concepts is reviewed; in the second, what sort of explanatory model best accounts for these concepts are discussed. Two sorts of models are compared, "dumb attentional mechanisms" vs "concepts-in-theories", and it is argued that the former is incomplete in ways that the later complement and address. In this second discussion, the authors also briefly touch on the difficult and largely unresolved issue of how prelinguistic categorization differ from categories once children have language.

@phdthesis{esterly_its_nodate,
	abstract = {Developments in buoyancy and material kind understanding were investigated. Material kinds are the ``stuff'' of which things are made (e.g. wood). Everyday, predictions and explanations of the physical world are based on knowledge and understanding of material kinds. When and in what ways do children utilize their developing understanding of material kinds to make judgments about the physical world? As children begin to realize that objects in the world are made of different kinds of ``stuff'', how do they make use of this knowledge? The answer to these questions have important implications for our understanding of the organization and development of children's scientific knowledge and the creation of science curriculum for elementary and preschool classrooms.
In three experiments, children between three and seven years of age participated in four different tasks; a buoyancy task, a material induction task, a material identification task, and a material naming task. In the buoyancy task, participants were asked to predict and explain which of a set of objects would sink or float. For the material induction task, our lab designed a machine that lit up and played a song when wooden objects were placed on it. Participants were asked to predict and explain which objects would turn on the machine. In the material kind naming and sorting tasks, participants were shown pairs of objects. They were asked if the objects were made of the ``same kind of stuff'' or ``different kinds of stuff'' and then asked to name what kind of ``stuff'' out of which the objects were made.
It was hypothesized and found that major developments in material kind and buoyancy understanding began around four years of age. Moreover, material consistent explanations and predictions on the buoyancy and induction task were related. It was hypothesized and shown that with age material kind and other relevant (e.g. weight) explanations were increasingly used to explain both buoyancy and a novel material property. It was hypothesized and found that increased performance on the material naming and identification tasks was related to increased performance and increased use of material kind explanations on the buoyancy and induction tasks.},

@phdthesis{ware_form_nodate,
	abstract = {This research explored how experience with relations between object shape and function encourages children to use shape to categorize artifacts. Prior studies suggest that early categorization is largely based on shape similarities and, thus, is perceptually-bound. Conversely, other research demonstrates that children can use conceptually-based criteria, such as function information. Rather than asking if they use either perceptual or conceptual properties, the current work explored the possibility that conceptually-motivated strategies underlie children's category-based judgments both when they use perceptual features and when they use deeper conceptual information.
Specifically, this research asked whether children often use shape when categorizing because they are aware that it is related to conceptual properties that reliably pinpoint category boundaries. This should lead children to view shape itself as a reliable cue to category membership. For artifacts, this suggests that children learn to rely on shape for categorization partly through observing that it is typically related to function---a property that is conceptually central to artifact categories. This account requires that children begin to learn about shape-function relations before any general tendency for shape-based categorization emerges. The first two studies sought to provide evidence for this claim. I asked whether observing an object's function would encourage 18-month-olds to attend to and think about its shape. The first study did not reveal such an effect; however, the second study showed that having information about an object's function facilitated participants' use of shape to categorize that object. This suggests that 18-month-olds are sensitive to the fact that shape and function are typically related. The third study explored how children's awareness of such relations further contributes to early shape-based categorization. The results showed that extended experience with artifact categories possessing clear shape-function relations encouraged 18-month-olds to rely on shape when categorizing.
These findings support the proposal that children begin to use shape as they learn that it is connected to conceptually-based category markers. This suggests that conceptual knowledge actually plays a role in children's use of shape. This account of early artifact categorization is discussed in the broader context of research on children's and adults' object categorization.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates geometric and ontological aspects of shape concepts underlying the semantics of nouns. Considering the German shape nouns Ecke and Knick (corner and kink) we offer a geometric framework to characterize substantial aspects of shape based on features of the object's boundary. Using the axiomatic method, we develop a geometric system, called `planar shape geometry', enriching the basic inventory of ordering geometry by shape curves. The geometric characterization is not sufficient to decide which are the referents of the nouns Ecke and Knick among the entities involved in the spatial constellation. Different tests using the German topological prepositions in and an (in and at) are employed to bring forth this decision for the case of Ecke. Since these tests do not give uniform evidence in favor of one solution, we have to conclude that Ecke is flexible in selecting the referent and the characterizations discussed reflect its meaning spectrum.},

Here representative researchers from these fields discuss and report on new work and insights centered around the concepts of function, feature, and functional feature, and consider how these relate to research on language and space and to cognitive science more generally. The introduction sets the issues within the context of research of linguistics and cognitive science, and explains the different perspective associated with each of the chapters.

@phdthesis{jaswal_developmental_nodate,
	abstract = {Categorization is fundamental to human cognition, enabling communication and serving as the basis for the representation of objects and for predicting and explaining their behavior. We can usually rely on an object's perceptual features to decide which category it belongs to, but appearances can be deceiving. For example, eels look like snakes, but they are more accurately categorized as FISH. The labels applied to objects offer a potentially valuable source of information about category membership---one that is not necessarily tied to appearance. Indeed, very young children often weigh the category label applied to an object more heavily than its appearance when the two conflict, choosing to make non-obvious inferences about an item on the basis of its label rather than its appearance, for example. This suggests that they recognize that surface similarity is only a rough guide to kind membership. Nonetheless, children are occasionally unwilling to accept ``on faith'' that a label used by an adult speaker is a better cue to kind than appearance.
The studies in this dissertation used a category induction paradigm to investigate circumstances under which preschoolers were willing to accept another speaker's anomalous labels, or to adhere to what Putnam (1973) described in adult word use as a ``division of linguistic labor.'' Study 1 showed that 3-year-olds were more willing to accept: a label (e.g., ``dog'') for an item whose appearance was ambiguous (e.g., a cat-dog) than one whose appearance strongly suggested membership in a category different from the label (e.g., a cat-like animal). Studies 2a and 2b found that 3-year-olds were more willing to accept anomalous labels than 4-year-olds---unless they had explicit evidence that the speaker meant to use those labels. Finally, Study 3 showed that a subtle pragmatic cue in the form of prenominal modification of the anomalous labels (e.g., ``Tamil dog'' or ``furry dog'') also made 4-year-olds more likely to accept those labels. In summary, whether children accept an unexpected label as indicative of kind depends crucially on just how anomalous the label is, as well as on whether they are certain that the speaker's use of that label was intentional in the first place.},

@book{scholnick_conceptual_1999,
	abstract = {This book examines a key issue in current cognitive theories - the nature of representation. Each chapter is characterized by attempts to frame hot topics in cognitive development within the landscape of current developmental theorizing and the past legacy of genetic epistemology. The chapters address four questions that are fundamental to any developmental line of inquiry:

How should we represent the workings and contents of the mind?
How does the child construct mental models during the course of development?
What are the origins of these models? and
What accounts for the novelties that are the products and producers of developmental change?
These questions are situated in a historical context, Piagetian theory, and contemporary researchers attempt to trace how they draw upon, depart from, and transform the Piagetian legacy to revisit classic issues such as the child's awareness of the workings of mental life, the child's ability to represent the world, and the child's growing ability to process and learn from experience. The theoretical perspectives covered include constructivism, connectionism, theory-theory, information processing, dynamical systems, and social constructivist approaches. The research areas span imitation, mathematical reasoning, biological knowledge, language development, and theory of mind.
Written by major contributors to the field, this work will be of interest to students and researchers wanting a brief but in-depth overview of the contemporary field of cognitive development.},

@article{van_de_walle_bases_2000,
	abstract = {Two studies exploited a new manual search methodology to assess the bases on which 10- to 12-month-olds individuate objects. Infants saw 1 or 2 objects placed inside an opaque box, into which they could reach. Across conditions, the information specifying 2 objects differed. The dependent measures reflected persistence of reaching into a box that was empty regardless of whether an object should have remained. Success consists of little reaching after all objects are removed and persistent reaching for an object not yet retrieved. Given spatiotemporal information for 2 objects, both age groups succeeded. Given only property or kind information, only 12-month-olds succeeded. Despite disparate information-processing demands, this pattern converges with looking time data (Xu \& Carey, 1996; Xu, Carey, \& Welch, 1999), suggesting a developmental change orthogonal to that of executive function. This change may reflect the emergence of kind representations.},

	abstract = {This book examines a key issue in current cognitive theories - the nature of representation. Each chapter is characterized by attempts to frame hot topics in cognitive development within the landscape of current developmental theorizing and the past legacy of genetic epistemology. The chapters address four questions that are fundamental to any developmental line of inquiry:  How should we represent the workings and contents of the mind? How does the child construct mental models during the course of development? What are the origins of these models? and What accounts for the novelties that are the products and producers of developmental change? These questions are situated in a historical context, Piagetian theory, and contemporary researchers attempt to trace how they draw upon, depart from, and transform the Piagetian legacy to revisit classic issues such as the child's awareness of the workings of mental life, the child's ability to represent the world, and the child's growing ability to process and learn from experience. The theoretical perspectives covered include constructivism, connectionism, theory-theory, information processing, dynamical systems, and social constructivist approaches. The research areas span imitation, mathematical reasoning, biological knowledge, language development, and theory of mind. Written by major contributors to the field, this work will be of interest to students and researchers wanting a brief but in-depth overview of the contemporary field of cognitive development.},

	abstract = {What is the nature of early words? Specifically, do infants expect words for objects to refer to kinds or to distinct shapes? The current study investigated this question by testing whether 10-month-olds expect internal object properties to be predicted by linguistic labels. A looking-time method was employed. Infants were familiarized with pairs of identical or different objects that made identical or different sounds. During test, before the sounds were demonstrated, paired objects were labeled with one repeated count-noun label or two distinct labels. Results showed that infants expected objects labeled with distinct labels to make different sounds and objects labeled with repeated labels to make identical sounds, regardless of the objects' appearance. These findings indicate that the 10-month-olds' expectations about internal properties of objects were driven by labeling and provide evidence that even at the beginning of word learning, infants expect distinct labels to refer to different kinds.},

	abstract = {This experiment assessed the role of count/mass syntax in the acquisition of object words and substance words by 2- and 212-year-olds. Unfamiliar objects were labelled with mass nouns and unfamiliar substances were labelled with count nouns. It was found that there was a subgroup of 2-year-olds who did not yet produce count/mass syntax and were not sensitive to it in the word-learning task, but who nonetheless distinguished objects from substances. From this result it was argued that children do not learn to make the distinction between objects and substances through the count/mass distinction, in contrast to claims by Quine (1969). The other 2-year-olds and the 212-year-olds were affected by the syntactic information, especially on the substance trials. That is, when a substance was labelled by a new noun, the subcategorization of the noun influenced children's willingness to construe the referent as a token of a kind of pile (e.g., a puddle), rather than as a portion of a substance (e.g., some mud). It is argued that these children use syntactic information as well as perceptual information to form a construal of the referents of new words. It is also argued that the weight given to the syntactic information varies as a function of the ontological and quantificational properties of the referent.},

Two experiments tested the proposal that experience in learning object names tunes children's attention to the properties relevant for naming--in the present case, to the property of shape--and thus facilitates the learning of more object names. In Experiment 1, a 9-week longitudinal study, 17-month-old children who repeatedly played with and heard names for members of unfamiliar object categories well organized by shapeformed the generalization that only objects with ith similar shapes have the same name. Trained children also showed a dramatic increase in acquisition of new object names outside of the laboratory during the course of the study. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and showed that they depended on children's learning both a coherent category structure and object names. Thus, children who learn specific names for specific things in categories with a common organizing property--in this case, shape--also learn to attend to just the right property--in this case, shape--for learning more object names.},

@article{imai_childrens_1994,
	abstract = {This research contrasts two important proposals as to children's assumptions about word meanings: the taxonomic assumption proposal and the shape bias proposal. Both proposals agree that children focus on groups of ``like kind'' in word meaning extension, but they differ in their assumption as to the nature of ``likeness'' for young children. We tested the two proposals by separating and comparing category membership and perceptual similarity in a word/no-word match-to-sample task. Two age groups of children, 3- and 5-year-olds, were shown a standard picture (e.g., an apple) and three other pictures: a taxonomically similar object (e.g., a banana), a perceptually similar object (e.g., a ball) and a thematically related object (e.g., a knife). They were asked either: ``This is a dax; show me another dax'' or ``Find the one that goes with this one.'' There were two main results. First, both age groups showed a pronounced shift from thematic-based to shape-based responding when novel words were given. Second, a developmental shift was found from shape responding to taxonomic responding in the presence of a novel word. These results suggest that perceptual similarity (in particular, shape similarity) is very important in early word meaning, but that children gradually shift their attention to deeper properties. We conjecture that this early focus on perceptual similarity may help young children learn categories, gradually bootstrapping them to a sense of taxonomic relations that goes beyond perceptual similarity.},

	abstract = {This research tested the hypothesis that young children's bias to generalize names for solid objects by shape is the product of statistical regularities among nouns in the early productive vocabulary. Data from a 4-layer Hopfield network suggested that the statistical regularities in the early noun vocabulary are strong enough to create a shape bias, and that the shape bias is overgeneralized to nonsolid stimuli. A 2nd simulation suggested that this overgeneralization is due to the dominance of names for shape-based categories in the early noun vocabulary. Two subsequent longitudinal experiments tested whether it is possible to create word learning biases in children. Children 15-20 months old were given intensive naming experiences with 12 noun categories typical of the types of categories children learn to name early. The children developed a precocious shape bias that was overgeneralized to naming nonsolid substances; they also showed accelerated vocabulary development. Children taught an atypical set of nouns or no new nouns did not develop a shape bias and did not show accelerated vocabulary development.},

@article{gershkoff-stowe_shape_2004,
	abstract = {This paper reports evidence from a longitudinal study in which children's attention to shape in a laboratory task of artificial noun learning was correlated with a rate shift in noun acquisitions. Eight children were tested in the laboratory at 3-week intervals beginning when they had less than 25 nouns in their productive vocabulary (M age=17 months). Children were presented with a novel word generalization task at each session. Additionally, the study examined the kinds of words the children learned early, based on parent reports, and the statistical regularities inherent in those vocabularies. The results indicate that as children learned nouns, they also learned to attend to shape in the novel word task. At the same time, children showed an acceleration in new noun production outside of the laboratory.},

Four experiments presented 84 3-yr-olds and 84 undergraduates with novel artifacts consisting of distinctive base objects with appended parts. Ss were asked to make naming and similarity judgments. Ss in 2 experiments were shown a function for either the base object or the parts. Adults' naming and similarity judgments were both influenced by the functional information. Children's similarity judgments were influenced by the functions; however, their naming was immune to influence from information about function. Their feature selection in naming was shifted only by changes in the relative salience of base objects and parts. Results are consistent with the idea that dumb attentional processes are responsible for young children's smart generalizations of novel words to new instances. Potential mechanisms to explain these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{diesendruck_how_2003,
	abstract = {Children tend to extend object names on the basis of sameness of shape, rather than size, color, or material-a tendency that has been dubbed the "shape bias." Is the shape bias the result of well-learned associations between words and objects? Or does it exist because of a general belief that shape is a good indicator of object category membership? The present three studies addressed this debate by exploring whether the shape bias is specific to naming. In Study 1, 3-year-olds showed the shape bias both when asked to extend a novel name and when asked to select an object of the same kind as a target object. Study 2 found the same shape bias when children were asked to generalize properties relevant to category membership. Study 3 replicated the findings from Study 1 with 2-year-olds. These findings suggest that the shape bias derives from children's beliefs about object kinds and is not the product of associative learning.

We then reduced this shape bias and amplified a bias to generalize nouns by material similarity via manipulations of training and stimuli across 3 other conditions. Additional analyses suggest that children's generalizations on individual trials are influenced by what they have seen and done on previous trials.

Forty-six 15-month-olds were presented with novel target objects that possessed a nonobvious property, followed by test objects that varied in shape, color, or texture relative to the target. Infants generalized the nonobvious property to test objects that were highly similar in shape, but not to objects that shared the same color or texture. These results demonstrate that infants' attention to shape is not specific to lexical contexts and is present at the early stages of productive language development. The implications of these findings for debates about children's shape bias, in particular, and the nature of infants' categories more generally, are discussed.},

@article{barner_language_2009,
	abstract = {We test the claim that acquiring a mass-count language, like English, causes speakers to think differently about entities in the world, relative to speakers of classifier languages like Japanese. We use three tasks to assess this claim: object-substance rating, quantity judgment, and word extension. Using the first two tasks, we present evidence that learning mass-count syntax has little effect on the interpretation of familiar nouns between Japanese and English, and that speakers of these languages do not divide up referents differently along an individuation continuum, as claimed in some previous reports [Gentner, D., \& Boroditsky, L. (2001). Individuation, relativity, and early word learning. In M. Bowerman, \& S. Levinson (Eds.), Language acquisition and conceptual development (pp. 215-256). Cambridge University Press]. Instead, we argue that previous cross-linguistic differences [Imai, M., \& Gentner, D. (1997). A cross-linguistic study of early word meaning: Universal ontology and linguistic influence. Cognition, 62, 169-200] are attributable to "lexical statistics" [Gleitman, L., \& Papafragou, A. (2005). Language and thought. In K. Holyoak, \& R. Morrison (Eds.), Cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning (pp. 633-661). Cambridge University Press]. Speakers of English are more likely to think that a novel ambiguous expression like "the blicket" refers to a kind of object (relative to speakers of Japanese) because speakers of English are likely to assume that "blicket" is a count noun rather than a mass noun, based on the relative frequency of each kind of word in English. This is confirmed by testing Mandarin-English bilinguals with a word extension task. We find that bilinguals tested in English with mass-count ambiguous syntax extend novel words like English monolinguals (and assume that a word like "blicket" refers to a kind of object). In contrast, bilinguals tested in Mandarin are significantly more likely to extend novel words by material. Thus, online lexical statistics, rather than non-linguistic thought, mediate cross-linguistic differences in word extension. We suggest that speakers of Mandarin, English, and Japanese draw on a universal set of lexical meanings, and that mass-count syntax allows speakers of English to select among these meanings.},

	abstract = {A major problem in language learning is to figure out the meaning of a word given the enormous number of possible meanings for any particular word. This problem is exacerbated for children because they often find thematic relations between objects to be more salient than the objects' taxonomic category. Four experiments, with 193 2--5 yr old children, tested the hypothesis that children limit the possible meanings of nouns to refer mainly to categorical relations. Ss were presented with a series of target objects (e.g., dog), each followed by a thematic associate (e.g., bone) and a taxonomic associate (e.g., cat). When Ss were told to choose another object that was similar to the target, they as usual often selected the thematic associate. In contrast, when the instructions included an unknown word for the target, Ss preferred the taxonomic associate. This finding held up for 2- and 3-yr-olds at the basic level of categorization, for 4- and 5-yr-olds at the superordinate level of categorization, and for 4- and 5-yr-olds who were taught new taxonomic and new thematic relations for unfamiliar objects. In each case, Ss constrained the meaning of new nouns to refer mainly to categorical relations. By limiting the hypotheses that children need to consider, this constraint tremendously simplifies the problem of language learning.

If any of these accounts are accurate, there should be parallel developments in comprehension. To explore this issue, 4 studies assessed whether pre- and postnaming explosion children differ in their ability to learn a new word after limited exposure. 13- and 18-mo-olds heard a new object label just 9 times in a 5-min training session and then their comprehension was assessed in a multiple-choice procedure. Under favorable testing conditions, both 18- and 13-mo-olds showed comprehension of the new word, even after a 24-hr delay. These results suggest that well before the productive naming explosion, children can learn a new object label quickly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Finally, the package provides various plot functions (for example, for forest, funnel, and radial plots) and functions for assessing the model fit, for obtaining case diagnostics, and for tests of publication bias.},

	abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

@article{gentner_1978,
	abstract = {The acquisition of verb meaning is very different from the acquisition of simple noun (concrete and proper) meaning. Verbs are slower to be acquired than simple nouns and are used by children and adults with greater breadth of application. Finally, a componential account of meaning appears to fit the acquisition of verb meaning somewhat better than it does that of simple nouns. These differences reflect an important difference in the kind of meaning conveyed by verbs and simple nouns: Simple nouns refer to real-world entities, and verbs convey relationships among entities. The theories of E. V. Clark (1973) and K. Nelson (see record 1974-32036-001) are prominently considered. (38 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
