    abstract = { The model selection literature has been generally poor at reflecting the deep foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and at making appropriate comparisons to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging. }

    abstract = { Research suggests that variability of exemplars supports successful object categorization; however, the scope of variability’s support at the level of higher-order generalization remains unexplored. Using a longitudinal study, we examined the role of exemplar variability in first- and second-order generalization in the context of nominal-category learning at an early age. Sixteen 18-month-old children were taught 12 categories. Half of the children were taught with sets of highly similar exemplars; the other half were taught with sets of dissimilar, variable exemplars. Participants’ learning and generalization of trained labels and their development of more general word-learning biases were tested. All children were found to have learned labels for trained exemplars, but children trained with variable exemplars generalized to novel exemplars of these categories, developed a discriminating word-learning bias generalizing labels of novel solid objects by shape and labels of nonsolid objects by material, and accelerated in vocabulary acquisition. These findings demonstrate that object variability leads to better abstraction of individual and global category organization, which increases learning outside the laboratory. }

abstract = {Abstract Two experiments examined the role of perceptual complexity, object familiarity and form class cues on how children interpret novel adjectives and count nouns. Four-year-old children participated in a forced-choice match-to-target task in which an exemplar was named with a novel word and children were asked to choose another one that matched the exemplar in either shape or material. In experiment 1, 56 children were provided with lexical form class cues suggestive of adjectives. The results of Experiment 1 showed that perceptual complexity and not object familiarity determined whether children made material or shape matches. In Experiment 2, 56 children were provided with lexical form class cues suggestive of count nouns. The results of Experiment 2 showed that neither perceptual complexity nor object familiarity affected children's selections in the matching task. When provided with lexical form class cues suggestive of a count noun, children selected shape matches. Thus the results suggest that the perceptual properties of the objects presented to children coupled with the particular lexical form class cue determine which features of objects children attend to when interpreting novel words.},

abstract = {Development in any domain is often characterized by increasingly abstract representations. Recent evidence in the domain of shape recognition provides one example; between 18 and 24 months children appear to build increasingly abstract representations of object shape [Smith, L. B. (2003). Learning to recognize objects. Psychological Science, 14, 244–250]. Abstraction is in part simplification because it requires the removal of irrelevant information. At the same time, part of generalization is ignoring irrelevant differences. The resulting prediction is this: simplification may enable generalization. Four experiments asked whether simple training instances could shortcut the process of abstraction and directly promote appropriate generalization. Toddlers were taught novel object categories with either simple or complex training exemplars. We found that children who learned with simple objects were able to generalize according to shape similarity, typically relevant for early object categories, better than those who learned with complex objects. Abstraction is the product of learning; using simplified – already abstracted instances – can short-cut that learning, leading to robust generalization.}

abstract = {Much research has demonstrated a shape bias in categorizing and naming solid objects. This research has shown that when an entity is conceptualized as an individual object, adults and children attend to the object’s shape. Separate research in the domain of numerical cognition suggest that there are distinct processes for quantifying small and large sets of discrete items. This research shows that small set discrimination, comparison, and apprehension is often precise for 1–3 and sometimes 4 items; however, large numerosity representation is imprecise. Results from three experiments suggest a link between the processes for small and large number representation and the shape bias in a forced choice categorization task using naming and non-naming procedures. Experiment 1 showed that adults generalized a newly learned name for an object to new instances of the same shape only when those instances were presented in sets of less than 3 or 4. Experiment 2 showed that preschool children who were monolingual speakers of three different languages were also influenced by set size when categorizing objects in sets. Experiment 3 extended these results and showed the same effect in a non-naming task and when the novel noun was presented in a count-noun syntax frame. The results are discussed in terms of a relation between the precision of object representation and the precision of small and large number representation.}

ABSTRACT={Children acquire attentional biases that help them generalize novel words to novel objects. Researchers have proposed that these biases arise from regularities in the early noun vocabulary children learn and suggest that the specifics of the biases should be tied to the specifics of individual children’s vocabularies. However, evidence supporting this proposal to date comes from studies of group means. The current study examines the relations between the statistics of the nouns young children learn and the similarities and differences in the biases they demonstrate. We show that individual differences in vocabulary structure predict individual differences in novel noun generalization. Thus, these data support the proposal that word-learning biases emerge from the regularities present in individual children’s vocabularies and, importantly, that children’s online attention during an experiment is mediated by instances of past learning. }}

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that young children selectively attend to some object properties and ignore others when generalizing a newly learned object name. Moreover, the specific properties children attend to depend on the stimulus and task context. The present study tested an attentional account: that children's feature selection in name generalization is guided by non-strategic attentional processes that are minimally influenced by new conceptual information presented in the task. Four experiments presented 3-year-old children and adults with novel artifacts consisting of distinctive base objects with appended parts. In a Name condition, subjects were asked whether test objects had the same name as the exemplar. In a Similarity condition, subjects made similarity judgments for the same objects. Subjects in two experiments were shown a function for either the base object or the parts. Both adults' naming and similarity judgments were influenced by the functional information. Children's similarity judgments were also influenced by the functions. However, children's naming was immune to influence from information about function. Instead, children's feature selection in naming was shifted only by changes in the relative salience of base objects and parts. The results are consistent with the idea that dumb attentional processes are responsible for young children's smart generalizations of novel words to new instances. Potential mechanisms to explain these findings are discussed.}

Which one goes with this one?’). Fifty-four preschool children (16 with SLI, 16 children with typical language [TL] in an equated control group, and 22 additional children with TL included in individual differences analyses but not group comparisons) completed a battery of linguistic and cognitive assessments and two experiments. In Experiment 1, children made generalization choices in object naming and similarity classification contexts on separate days, from options similar to a target object in shape, color, or texture. On average, TL children exhibited the shape bias in an object naming context, but children with SLI did not. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the failure to exhibit the shape bias might be linked to ability to detect systematicities in the visual domain. Experiment 2 supported this hypothesis, in that children with SLI failed to learn simple paired visual associations that were readily learned by children with TL. Analyses of individual differences in the two studies revealed that visual paired-associate learning predicted degree of shape bias in children with SLI and TL better than any other measure of nonverbal intelligence or standard assessments of language ability. We discuss theoretical and clinical implications.},

Or does it exist because of a general belief that shape is a good indicator of object category membership? The present three studies addressed this debate by exploring whether the shape bias is specific to naming. In Study 1, 3–year–olds showed the shape bias both when asked to extend a novel name and when asked to select an object of the same kind as a target object. Study 2 found the same shape bias when children were asked to generalize properties relevant to category membership. Study 3 replicated the findings from Study 1 with 2–year–olds. These findings suggest that the shape bias derives from children's beliefs about object kinds and is not the product of associative learning.},

ABSTRACT={This paper explores the effect of classifiers on young children’s conceptual structures. For this purpose we studied Mandarin Chinese- and German-speaking three- and five-year-olds on non-lexical classification, novel-noun label extension and inductive inference of novel properties. Some effect of the classifier system was found in Chinese children, but this effect was observed only in a non-lexical categorization task. In the label extension and property generalization tasks, children of the two language groups show strikingly similar behavior. The implications of the results for theories of the relation between language and thought as well as cultural influence on thought are discussed.}}

Three experiments were conducted to disentangle the role of taxonomic relations and shape similarity in 18- and 24-month-olds’ responses on a noun category bias task. The relationship between vocabulary composition and performance on these tasks was also examined. Results indicated that both 18- and 24-month-old children were predominantly guided by shape similarity when extending novel labels. However, some evidence that taxonomic information can be used to guide word extension was found in the 24-month-old group. Those children with a larger proportion of nouns in their vocabulary were more likely to use information about category membership when extending words, even in the absence of shape similarity.},

However, in the field of development, the phenomena of interest are complex, multifaceted, and change over time. Here, we use three decades of research on the shape bias to argue that while replication is clearly an important part of the scientific process, integration across the findings of many studies that include variations in procedure is also critical to create a coherent understanding of the thoughts and behaviors of young children. The “shape bias,” or the tendency to generalize a novel label to novel objects of the same shape, is a reliable and robust behavioral finding and has been shown to predict future vocabulary growth and possible language disorders. Despite the robustness of the phenomenon, the way in which the shape bias is defined and tested has varied across studies and laboratories. The current review argues that differences in performance that come from even seemingly minor changes to the participants or task can offer critical insight to underlying mechanisms, and that working to incorporate data from multiple labs is an important way to reveal how task variation and a child’s individual pathway creates behavior—a key issue for understanding developmental phenomena.}

By this we mean that the categories of young children include information about ontology, causation, function, intentions, and other properties that are not directly observable. Moreover, children use their categories to form important inferences and explanation that go beyond the available evidence. In the first part of the chapter we review evidence for theory-based concepts is reviewed; in the second, what sort of explanatory model best accounts for these concepts are discussed. Two sorts of models are compared, "dumb attentional mechanisms" vs "concepts-in-theories", and it is argued that the former is incomplete in ways that the later complement and address. In this second discussion, the authors also briefly touch on the difficult and largely unresolved issue of how prelinguistic categorization differ from categories once children have language.

	abstract = {Developments in buoyancy and material kind understanding were investigated. Material kinds are the ``stuff'' of which things are made (e.g. wood). Everyday, predictions and explanations of the physical world are based on knowledge and understanding of material kinds. When and in what ways do children utilize their developing understanding of material kinds to make judgments about the physical world? As children begin to realize that objects in the world are made of different kinds of ``stuff'', how do they make use of this knowledge? The answer to these questions have important implications for our understanding of the organization and development of children's scientific knowledge and the creation of science curriculum for elementary and preschool classrooms.
In three experiments, children between three and seven years of age participated in four different tasks; a buoyancy task, a material induction task, a material identification task, and a material naming task. In the buoyancy task, participants were asked to predict and explain which of a set of objects would sink or float. For the material induction task, our lab designed a machine that lit up and played a song when wooden objects were placed on it. Participants were asked to predict and explain which objects would turn on the machine. In the material kind naming and sorting tasks, participants were shown pairs of objects. They were asked if the objects were made of the ``same kind of stuff'' or ``different kinds of stuff'' and then asked to name what kind of ``stuff'' out of which the objects were made.
It was hypothesized and found that major developments in material kind and buoyancy understanding began around four years of age. Moreover, material consistent explanations and predictions on the buoyancy and induction task were related. It was hypothesized and shown that with age material kind and other relevant (e.g. weight) explanations were increasingly used to explain both buoyancy and a novel material property. It was hypothesized and found that increased performance on the material naming and identification tasks was related to increased performance and increased use of material kind explanations on the buoyancy and induction tasks.},

@phdthesis{ware_form_nodate,
	abstract = {This research explored how experience with relations between object shape and function encourages children to use shape to categorize artifacts. Prior studies suggest that early categorization is largely based on shape similarities and, thus, is perceptually-bound. Conversely, other research demonstrates that children can use conceptually-based criteria, such as function information. Rather than asking if they use either perceptual or conceptual properties, the current work explored the possibility that conceptually-motivated strategies underlie children's category-based judgments both when they use perceptual features and when they use deeper conceptual information.
Specifically, this research asked whether children often use shape when categorizing because they are aware that it is related to conceptual properties that reliably pinpoint category boundaries. This should lead children to view shape itself as a reliable cue to category membership. For artifacts, this suggests that children learn to rely on shape for categorization partly through observing that it is typically related to function---a property that is conceptually central to artifact categories. This account requires that children begin to learn about shape-function relations before any general tendency for shape-based categorization emerges. The first two studies sought to provide evidence for this claim. I asked whether observing an object's function would encourage 18-month-olds to attend to and think about its shape. The first study did not reveal such an effect; however, the second study showed that having information about an object's function facilitated participants' use of shape to categorize that object. This suggests that 18-month-olds are sensitive to the fact that shape and function are typically related. The third study explored how children's awareness of such relations further contributes to early shape-based categorization. The results showed that extended experience with artifact categories possessing clear shape-function relations encouraged 18-month-olds to rely on shape when categorizing.
These findings support the proposal that children begin to use shape as they learn that it is connected to conceptually-based category markers. This suggests that conceptual knowledge actually plays a role in children's use of shape. This account of early artifact categorization is discussed in the broader context of research on children's and adults' object categorization.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates geometric and ontological aspects of shape concepts underlying the semantics of nouns. Considering the German shape nouns Ecke and Knick (corner and kink) we offer a geometric framework to characterize substantial aspects of shape based on features of the object's boundary. Using the axiomatic method, we develop a geometric system, called `planar shape geometry', enriching the basic inventory of ordering geometry by shape curves. The geometric characterization is not sufficient to decide which are the referents of the nouns Ecke and Knick among the entities involved in the spatial constellation. Different tests using the German topological prepositions in and an (in and at) are employed to bring forth this decision for the case of Ecke. Since these tests do not give uniform evidence in favor of one solution, we have to conclude that Ecke is flexible in selecting the referent and the characterizations discussed reflect its meaning spectrum.},

@phdthesis{jaswal_developmental_nodate,
	abstract = {Categorization is fundamental to human cognition, enabling communication and serving as the basis for the representation of objects and for predicting and explaining their behavior. We can usually rely on an object's perceptual features to decide which category it belongs to, but appearances can be deceiving. For example, eels look like snakes, but they are more accurately categorized as FISH. The labels applied to objects offer a potentially valuable source of information about category membership---one that is not necessarily tied to appearance. Indeed, very young children often weigh the category label applied to an object more heavily than its appearance when the two conflict, choosing to make non-obvious inferences about an item on the basis of its label rather than its appearance, for example. This suggests that they recognize that surface similarity is only a rough guide to kind membership. Nonetheless, children are occasionally unwilling to accept ``on faith'' that a label used by an adult speaker is a better cue to kind than appearance.
The studies in this dissertation used a category induction paradigm to investigate circumstances under which preschoolers were willing to accept another speaker's anomalous labels, or to adhere to what Putnam (1973) described in adult word use as a ``division of linguistic labor.'' Study 1 showed that 3-year-olds were more willing to accept: a label (e.g., ``dog'') for an item whose appearance was ambiguous (e.g., a cat-dog) than one whose appearance strongly suggested membership in a category different from the label (e.g., a cat-like animal). Studies 2a and 2b found that 3-year-olds were more willing to accept anomalous labels than 4-year-olds---unless they had explicit evidence that the speaker meant to use those labels. Finally, Study 3 showed that a subtle pragmatic cue in the form of prenominal modification of the anomalous labels (e.g., ``Tamil dog'' or ``furry dog'') also made 4-year-olds more likely to accept those labels. In summary, whether children accept an unexpected label as indicative of kind depends crucially on just how anomalous the label is, as well as on whether they are certain that the speaker's use of that label was intentional in the first place.},

Infants saw 1 or 2 objects placed inside an opaque box, into which they could reach. Across conditions, the information specifying 2 objects differed. The dependent measures reflected persistence of reaching into a box that was empty regardless of whether an object should have remained. Success consists of little reaching after all objects are removed and persistent reaching for an object not yet retrieved. Given spatiotemporal information for 2 objects, both age groups succeeded. Given only property or kind information, only 12-month-olds succeeded. Despite disparate information-processing demands, this pattern converges with looking time data (Xu \& Carey, 1996; Xu, Carey, \& Welch, 1999), suggesting a developmental change orthogonal to that of executive function. This change may reflect the emergence of kind representations.},

	abstract = {What is the nature of early words? Specifically, do infants expect words for objects to refer to kinds or to distinct shapes? The current study investigated this question by testing whether 10-month-olds expect internal object properties to be predicted by linguistic labels. A looking-time method was employed. Infants were familiarized with pairs of identical or different objects that made identical or different sounds. During test, before the sounds were demonstrated, paired objects were labeled with one repeated count-noun label or two distinct labels. Results showed that infants expected objects labeled with distinct labels to make different sounds and objects labeled with repeated labels to make identical sounds, regardless of the objects' appearance. These findings indicate that the 10-month-olds' expectations about internal properties of objects were driven by labeling and provide evidence that even at the beginning of word learning, infants expect distinct labels to refer to different kinds.},

	abstract = {This experiment assessed the role of count/mass syntax in the acquisition of object words and substance words by 2- and 212-year-olds. Unfamiliar objects were labelled with mass nouns and unfamiliar substances were labelled with count nouns. It was found that there was a subgroup of 2-year-olds who did not yet produce count/mass syntax and were not sensitive to it in the word-learning task, but who nonetheless distinguished objects from substances. From this result it was argued that children do not learn to make the distinction between objects and substances through the count/mass distinction, in contrast to claims by Quine (1969). The other 2-year-olds and the 212-year-olds were affected by the syntactic information, especially on the substance trials. That is, when a substance was labelled by a new noun, the subcategorization of the noun influenced children's willingness to construe the referent as a token of a kind of pile (e.g., a puddle), rather than as a portion of a substance (e.g., some mud). It is argued that these children use syntactic information as well as perceptual information to form a construal of the referents of new words. It is also argued that the weight given to the syntactic information varies as a function of the ontological and quantificational properties of the referent.},

Two experiments tested the proposal that experience in learning object names tunes children's attention to the properties relevant for naming--in the present case, to the property of shape--and thus facilitates the learning of more object names. In Experiment 1, a 9-week longitudinal study, 17-month-old children who repeatedly played with and heard names for members of unfamiliar object categories well organized by shapeformed the generalization that only objects with ith similar shapes have the same name. Trained children also showed a dramatic increase in acquisition of new object names outside of the laboratory during the course of the study. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and showed that they depended on children's learning both a coherent category structure and object names. Thus, children who learn specific names for specific things in categories with a common organizing property--in this case, shape--also learn to attend to just the right property--in this case, shape--for learning more object names.},

@article{imai_childrens_1994,
	abstract = {This research contrasts two important proposals as to children's assumptions about word meanings: the taxonomic assumption proposal and the shape bias proposal. Both proposals agree that children focus on groups of ``like kind'' in word meaning extension, but they differ in their assumption as to the nature of ``likeness'' for young children. We tested the two proposals by separating and comparing category membership and perceptual similarity in a word/no-word match-to-sample task. Two age groups of children, 3- and 5-year-olds, were shown a standard picture (e.g., an apple) and three other pictures: a taxonomically similar object (e.g., a banana), a perceptually similar object (e.g., a ball) and a thematically related object (e.g., a knife). They were asked either: ``This is a dax; show me another dax'' or ``Find the one that goes with this one.'' There were two main results. First, both age groups showed a pronounced shift from thematic-based to shape-based responding when novel words were given. Second, a developmental shift was found from shape responding to taxonomic responding in the presence of a novel word. These results suggest that perceptual similarity (in particular, shape similarity) is very important in early word meaning, but that children gradually shift their attention to deeper properties. We conjecture that this early focus on perceptual similarity may help young children learn categories, gradually bootstrapping them to a sense of taxonomic relations that goes beyond perceptual similarity.},

Data from a 4-layer Hopfield network suggested that the statistical regularities in the early noun vocabulary are strong enough to create a shape bias, and that the shape bias is overgeneralized to nonsolid stimuli. A 2nd simulation suggested that this overgeneralization is due to the dominance of names for shape-based categories in the early noun vocabulary. Two subsequent longitudinal experiments tested whether it is possible to create word learning biases in children. Children 15-20 months old were given intensive naming experiences with 12 noun categories typical of the types of categories children learn to name early. The children developed a precocious shape bias that was overgeneralized to naming nonsolid substances; they also showed accelerated vocabulary development. Children taught an atypical set of nouns or no new nouns did not develop a shape bias and did not show accelerated vocabulary development.},

Children were presented with a novel word generalization task at each session. Additionally, the study examined the kinds of words the children learned early, based on parent reports, and the statistical regularities inherent in those vocabularies.

Four experiments presented 84 3-yr-olds and 84 undergraduates with novel artifacts consisting of distinctive base objects with appended parts. Ss were asked to make naming and similarity judgments. Ss in 2 experiments were shown a function for either the base object or the parts. Adults' naming and similarity judgments were both influenced by the functional information. Children's similarity judgments were influenced by the functions; however, their naming was immune to influence from information about function. Their feature selection in naming was shifted only by changes in the relative salience of base objects and parts. Results are consistent with the idea that dumb attentional processes are responsible for young children's smart generalizations of novel words to new instances. Potential mechanisms to explain these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Is the shape bias the result of well-learned associations between words and objects? Or does it exist because of a general belief that shape is a good indicator of object category membership? The present three studies addressed this debate by exploring whether the shape bias is specific to naming. In Study 1, 3-year-olds showed the shape bias both when asked to extend a novel name and when asked to select an object of the same kind as a target object. Study 2 found the same shape bias when children were asked to generalize properties relevant to category membership. Study 3 replicated the findings from Study 1 with 2-year-olds. These findings suggest that the shape bias derives from children's beliefs about object kinds and is not the product of associative learning.

We then reduced this shape bias and amplified a bias to generalize nouns by material similarity via manipulations of training and stimuli across 3 other conditions. Additional analyses suggest that children's generalizations on individual trials are influenced by what they have seen and done on previous trials.

These results demonstrate that infants' attention to shape is not specific to lexical contexts and is present at the early stages of productive language development. The implications of these findings for debates about children's shape bias, in particular, and the nature of infants' categories more generally, are discussed.},

@article{barner_language_2009,
	abstract = {We test the claim that acquiring a mass-count language, like English, causes speakers to think differently about entities in the world, relative to speakers of classifier languages like Japanese. We use three tasks to assess this claim: object-substance rating, quantity judgment, and word extension. Using the first two tasks, we present evidence that learning mass-count syntax has little effect on the interpretation of familiar nouns between Japanese and English, and that speakers of these languages do not divide up referents differently along an individuation continuum, as claimed in some previous reports [Gentner, D., \& Boroditsky, L. (2001). Individuation, relativity, and early word learning. In M. Bowerman, \& S. Levinson (Eds.), Language acquisition and conceptual development (pp. 215-256). Cambridge University Press]. Instead, we argue that previous cross-linguistic differences [Imai, M., \& Gentner, D. (1997). A cross-linguistic study of early word meaning: Universal ontology and linguistic influence. Cognition, 62, 169-200] are attributable to "lexical statistics" [Gleitman, L., \& Papafragou, A. (2005). Language and thought. In K. Holyoak, \& R. Morrison (Eds.), Cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning (pp. 633-661). Cambridge University Press]. Speakers of English are more likely to think that a novel ambiguous expression like "the blicket" refers to a kind of object (relative to speakers of Japanese) because speakers of English are likely to assume that "blicket" is a count noun rather than a mass noun, based on the relative frequency of each kind of word in English. This is confirmed by testing Mandarin-English bilinguals with a word extension task. We find that bilinguals tested in English with mass-count ambiguous syntax extend novel words like English monolinguals (and assume that a word like "blicket" refers to a kind of object). In contrast, bilinguals tested in Mandarin are significantly more likely to extend novel words by material. Thus, online lexical statistics, rather than non-linguistic thought, mediate cross-linguistic differences in word extension. We suggest that speakers of Mandarin, English, and Japanese draw on a universal set of lexical meanings, and that mass-count syntax allows speakers of English to select among these meanings.},

Korean speakers gave more substance-based responses than the other groups, and their responses took functional information into account, while those of Spanish and English speakers did not.

They were then tested for their ability to produce and comprehend the new term and for whether they knew what semantic domain the word referred to. Results show that even 2-yr-old children quickly narrowed down the meaning of a word in each of the semantic domains examined, although Ss learned more about shape terms than color or texture words. Study 2, with 64 2-, 3-, and 4-yr-olds, explored the effects of several variables on Ss' ability to infer the meaning of a new term. For compelling contexts, Ss figured out the meaning of a new word even without hearing an explicit linguistic contrast. Findings suggest that fast mapping can be used successfully by younger and older children to form quick and rough hypotheses about the meaning of a new word.

@article{markman_childrens_1984,
	abstract = {A major problem in language learning is to figure out the meaning of a word given the enormous number of possible meanings for any particular word. This problem is exacerbated for children because they often find thematic relations between objects to be more salient than the objects' taxonomic category. Four experiments, with 193 2--5 yr old children, tested the hypothesis that children limit the possible meanings of nouns to refer mainly to categorical relations. Ss were presented with a series of target objects (e.g., dog), each followed by a thematic associate (e.g., bone) and a taxonomic associate (e.g., cat). When Ss were told to choose another object that was similar to the target, they as usual often selected the thematic associate. In contrast, when the instructions included an unknown word for the target, Ss preferred the taxonomic associate. This finding held up for 2- and 3-yr-olds at the basic level of categorization, for 4- and 5-yr-olds at the superordinate level of categorization, and for 4- and 5-yr-olds who were taught new taxonomic and new thematic relations for unfamiliar objects. In each case, Ss constrained the meaning of new nouns to refer mainly to categorical relations. By limiting the hypotheses that children need to consider, this constraint tremendously simplifies the problem of language learning.

If any of these accounts are accurate, there should be parallel developments in comprehension. To explore this issue, 4 studies assessed whether pre- and postnaming explosion children differ in their ability to learn a new word after limited exposure. 13- and 18-mo-olds heard a new object label just 9 times in a 5-min training session and then their comprehension was assessed in a multiple-choice procedure. Under favorable testing conditions, both 18- and 13-mo-olds showed comprehension of the new word, even after a 24-hr delay. These results suggest that well before the productive naming explosion, children can learn a new object label quickly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},
